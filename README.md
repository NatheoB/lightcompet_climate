# Contrasting effects of light competition on tree growth and survival along European temperature and water availability gradients
JEcol-2024-0168, currently in preparation, 

by Beauchamp, Nathéo; Kunstler, Georges; Touzot, Laura; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Cienciala, Emil; Dahlgren, Jonas; Hawryło, Paweł; Klopcic, Matija; Lehtonen, Aleksi; Šebeň, Vladimír; Socha, Jaroslaw; Zavala, Miguel; Courbaud, Benoit


## Pipeline
Repository containing:
1. The code to create the calibration database (harmonise forest inventories , compute climatic variables and compute the light competition index)
2. The code to run the calibration of the growth and mortality models
3. The RMarkdown file to run the analyses and create the output graphics

## Data availability
The data folder, required to run the code, can be made available upon request to natheo.beauchamp@inrae.fr (permanent email address: beauchamp.natheo@gmail.com) and georges.kunstler@inrae.fr

The models' outputs are available publicaly here: .....

## SamsaraLight model
To use the SamsaraLight model to compute the light competition index lci, please contact natheo.beauchamp@inrae.fr (permanent email address: beauchamp.natheo@gmail.com) and benoit.courbaud@inrae.fr

You can find more information about the model here: https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/help_en/samsaralight

The model is implemented within the Capsis platform, a simulation platform for forestry growth / dynamics models. It is a tool for forest scientists, forest managers and education. It has been developed in the AMAP laboratory since 1999 (https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/home).
