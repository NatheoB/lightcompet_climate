## Pipeline
Repository containing:
1. The code to create the calibration database (harmonise forest inventories , compute climatic variables and compute the light competition index)
2. The code to run the calibration of the growth and mortality models
3. The RMarkdown file to run the analyses and create the output graphics (main manuscript and appendices)


## Data availability
The models' outputs to run the main manuscript results are available publicaly in the Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14557538.

## SamsaraLight model
You can find more information about the model here: https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/help_en/samsaralight. The model is implemented within the Capsis platform, a simulation platform for forestry growth / dynamics models. It is a tool for forest scientists, forest managers and education. It has been developed in the AMAP laboratory since 1999 (https://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/home).
